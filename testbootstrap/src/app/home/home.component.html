    SAT and ACT Tutoring: Our tutors are experienced standardardized test takers, many scoring 400-500 points higher than average on the SAT and 4-5 points higher on the ACT. Our individualized help can prepare high schoolers for success on the English, math, and essay sections of both standardized tests, as well as the PSAT. 

    AP Test Prep: The diversity of academic skills of our tutors ensures that students can find assistance with nearly every AP Test. Texas Tutors members can organize review lessons, teach difficult concepts, and offer advice from experience, all without the cost of “professional” tutors. 
    
    General Tutoring: Texas Tutors offers one-on-one tutoring for students K-12. We are able to offer long term and personalized attention to help ensure that students can succeed in school. Our tutors are held to a professional standard of lesson prep, academic knowledge, and work ethic so that our students can succeed. Although minors cannot be tutored on UT campus, our tutors are more than willing to meet at local libraries, coffeeshops, or school campuses (with proper permission). Though are services are free, we pride ourselves on helping students succeed. 
    
    Essay Help: Many of our tutors are adept writers and can offer critical feedback on college essays or general student writing pieces. After we review a draft, we can meet in person with a student or schedule an online feedback session to help students bring their writing to college level standards.
